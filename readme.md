## 🚀 Overview

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Small contributions go unrecognized**, killing student motivation  
📌 No common space for **discovering projects, collaborators, and mentors**

## 💎 Why Peer Connect Stands Out

- ✅ **Student-First, Always** – Built for learners at every level  
- 🧰 **Utilizes Open Source AI Tools** – Scalable, free, and future-ready  
- 💸 **Completely Free** – Because education shouldn't cost dreams  
- 🧩 **Modular Architecture** – Use what you need, when you need it  
- 🌍 **Global Accessibility** – Cloud-based and device-friendly  
- 🤝 **Real Collaboration** – Not just content consumption, but co-creation  
- 🛠️ **Built With Purpose** – Not a placement hub, but a growth community

## AI Integrations

These integrations ensure PeerConnect goes beyond static content — providing mentorship, feedback, and preparation that truly guides learners toward employment.
